# GilDev’s Advent of Code Attempts

Here are my attempts at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

The repository is inspired by [Kevin Yap](https://github.com/iKevinY/advent)’s one. I often check his solutions after my attemps or when I’m stuck. A deep knowledge of Python will help a lot to do these quickly.

## Usage

```bash
python3 YYYY/dayDD.py < input.txt
```
