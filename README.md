# GilDev’s Advent of Code Attempts

Here are my attempts at the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges.

The repository is inspired by [Kevin Yap](https://github.com/iKevinY/advent)’s one. I often check his solutions after my attempts or when I’m stuck (so there may be some inspirations in my attempts, though I try not to look too much before completing a challenge). Sometimes I optimize my solutions a bit after checking his (simple stuff like list comprehension or slicing that I’m not quite used to yet).

A deep knowledge of Python will help a lot to do these challenges quickly.

## Usage

```bash
python3 YYYY/dayDD.py < input.txt
```
